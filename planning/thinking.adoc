The principal unit of concern in {app-name} is a **phrase**.

=== Phrases

Each phrase has a unique id.

Phrases are composed of **phrasal units** and have many **renderings**.

==== Phrasal Units

Each language can be broken down into the smallest possible orthographic unit that may be assigned semantic meaning.

For most languages, this is a word. This does **not** negate the fact that prosodic and phonetic variance in the utterance of syllable may be employed to significantly alter the meaning of a message in these languages, merely that at the **orthographic** level there is no meaningful unit smaller than a word (which may of course be monosyllabic).

For languages like Tibetan, Japanese, and Chinese -- where orthographic representations of single syllables can carry meaning even outside of the context of monosyllabic words -- the base unit is a syllable. Not all syllables have meaning.

Some examples:

For English, a language where the word is the smallest meaningful phrasal unit, the presence of a whitespace character indicates the boundary between the smallest possible units that can carry meaning.

For Tibetan, a language where the syllable is the smallest meaningful phrasal unit, the presence of a punctuating dot called a tsek (`à¼‹`) indicates the boundary between the smallest possible units that can carry meaning.

==== Renderings

A rendering is the orthographic representation of a phrase in a given language.

Each phrase and language combination will have exactly one rendering.

Renderings do not exist outside of phrases. <<phrases>>
