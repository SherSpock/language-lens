// One way of structuring responses. 
// Text nodes are returned in an array.
// Each text node knows its language and its segments.

{
    "texts": [
        {
            "language": "spanish",
            "segments": []
        },
        {
            "language": "english",
            "segments": []
        }
    ]
}

// Pros:
// Each node knows its language so no dependence on magic or ordering
// Cons:
// As the languages are presumably available in the request, this might not be right
